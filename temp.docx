We have two types of interaction between managing customers and managing shop’s internal action.

Work Flow of Managing Customer :

We have a database where we store the information of a customer, selling price and how much money we profit from a particular product. We arrange this profit in different steps. We keep track of our daily, weekly, monthly and yearly selling history. 

Work flow of managing shop’s internal interactions :

In this module we keep track of how much product an employee sells, the money we need to buy new product and the product information. Product information consists of their selling rate, their validation date, the customer whom we sell a particular product. We also keep information of the employee where we store employee name, date of join, current salary, commission and in case of his resign we store his total history.
